Sample Input 0

aabbbccde
Sample Output 0

b 3
a 2
c 2

Here, b occurs  times. It is printed first.
Both a and c occur  times. So, a is printed in the second line and c in the third line because a comes before c.

Note: The string  has at least  distinct characters.
from collections import Counter
from collections import OrderedDict
d = OrderedDict()
input = raw_input()
sizes_cnt = Counter(input)
d = OrderedDict(Counter(input).most_common(3))
for k,v in d.items():
    print(k),
    print(v)
